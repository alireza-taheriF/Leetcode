# Leetcode Solutions

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems.  
I try to solve a few problems every day (when I have time) and push them here regularly.

The goal is to stay consistent, improve my problem-solving skills, and build a solid foundation in algorithms and data structures.

All solutions are written in **Python**.

Feel free to browse around â€” and if you find something interesting or have suggestions, you're welcome to reach out.
